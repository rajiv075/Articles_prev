Mission Critical SAP Applications Are Under Active Attack,"April 06, 2021",Ravie Lakshmanan,"Cyber attackers are actively setting their sights on unsecured SAP applications in an attempt to steal information and sabotage critical processes, according to new research. ""Observed exploitation could lead in many cases to full control of the unsecured SAP application, bypassing common security and compliance controls, and enabling attackers to steal sensitive information, perform financial fraud or disrupt mission-critical business processes by deploying ransomware or stopping operations,"" cybersecurity firm Onapsis and SAP  said  in a joint report published today. The Boston-based company said it detected over 300 successful exploitations out of a total of 1,500 attempts targeting previously known vulnerabilities and insecure configurations specific to SAP systems between mid-2020 to March 2021, with multiple brute-force attempts made by adversaries aimed at high-privilege SAP accounts as well as chaining together several flaws to strike SAP applications.

The ATT&CK test measures cybersecurity platforms' abilities to detect and react to emulated, multistep attacks that can be used as a barometer of platform effectiveness.  This means that every cybersecurity vendor will be tripping over themselves to push out blog posts, webinars, press releases, and more touting how great their services are and how the results validate their products. The result is a storm of spin and PR that is hard to navigate. An upcoming webinar offered by Cynet ( register here ) aims to help industry participants differentiate the spin from the real information when it comes to MITRE ATT&CK results. The Webinar will be led by renowned cybersecurity researcher and Chief Security Strategist for Cynet, Chris Roberts, and Director of Product Marketing for Cynet, George Tubin.

The attacks have been attributed with low confidence to the advanced persistent threat (APT) called  Cycldek  (or Goblin Panda, Hellsing, APT 27, and Conimes), which is known for using spear-phishing techniques to compromise diplomatic targets in Southeast Asia, India, and the U.S. at least since 2013. According to researchers from Kaspersky, the offensive, which was observed between June 2020 and January 2021, leverages a method called DLL side-loading to execute shellcode that decrypts a final payload dubbed "" FoundCore ."" DLL side-loading  has been a tried-and-tested technique used by various threat actors as an obfuscation tactic to bypass antivirus defenses. By loading malicious DLLs into legitimate executables, the idea is to mask their malicious activity under a trusted system or software proc",Cyber Security

To increase the odds of success, the phishing lures take advantage of malicious ZIP archive files that have the same name as that of the victims' job titles taken from their LinkedIn profiles. ""For example, if the LinkedIn member's job is listed as Senior Account Executive—International Freight the malicious zip file would be titled Senior Account Executive—International Freight position (note the 'position' added to the end),"" cybersecurity firm eSentire's Threat Response Unit (TRU)  said  in an analysis. ""Upon opening the fake job offer, the victim unwittingly initiates the stealthy installation of the fileless backdoor, more_eggs.""

According to IBM Security's  2020 Cost of a Data Breach Report , there is a 50% increase in cloud usage for enterprises across all industries. The number of threats targeting cloud services, predominantly collaboration services like Office 365, has  increased 630% . Moreover, 75% of respondents report that discovery and recovery time from data breaches has significantly increased due to remote work during the pandemic. Although organizations can save over $1 million if they discover a breach in the first 30 days, the average reported response time was a whopping 280 days.  In the remote-work world, SaaS apps have become an enticing vector-of-choice for bad actors. Just think of the typical employee, working off-site, untrained in security measures, and how their access or privileges increase the risk of sensitive data being stolen, exposed, or compromised. However, it doesn't have to be that way — a company's SaaS security posture can be strengthened, an",Cyber Security

This is particularly true for organizations that use hybrid systems or a combination of cloud and local applications. Likewise, companies whose networks include a multitude of smartphones and IoT devices are likely to deploy multiple security solutions suitable for different scenarios. Employing several security solutions tends to be inevitable for many, especially those that have outgrown their previous network setups. Companies that expand to new branches and even overseas operations have to make use of additional security measures and tools. This use of multiple tools or software often leads to critical issues, though. The management of the many cybersecurity solutions can become too complicated and difficult to handle, especially for organizations with little experience in addressing cyber threats, let alone actual attacks. This can result in confusion and the inabilit",Cyber Security
